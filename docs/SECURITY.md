# Security

**Status: In Progress** — Phase 0 covers configuration hygiene, safe error handling, and logging redaction. Authentication, RBAC, signature verification, and audit logging are Planned.

Scope: the security model and its controls. Permission mechanics are in [AUTH.md](AUTH.md).

## Secrets and configuration

All secrets come from the environment. `.env` is never committed; `.env.example` documents required variables without values. No secrets in code, images, or CI logs. Tenant-specific WhatsApp credentials are stored with encryption at rest rather than as a single global token.

## Tenant isolation

Isolation is a security control, not a filter convenience. Every tenant-owned query is scoped by `tenant_id` in repositories and services; frontend filtering is never trusted. A client-provided tenant identifier is honoured only after membership verification. Cross-tenant access attempts are explicitly tested for conversations, contacts, leads, messages, documents, embeddings, WhatsApp accounts, agents, analytics, usage, and settings.

## Input and transport

Strong Pydantic validation on every request. Parameterised SQLAlchemy queries prevent injection. Request size limits, timeouts, and retry policies on outbound calls. CORS is configured explicitly per environment, with secure response headers at the proxy and application layers.

## Webhook security

Meta webhook signature verification against the raw request body, subscription challenge verification, and idempotency keyed on WhatsApp event IDs. Rate limiting must never cause loss of Meta webhook retries.

## Logging and error handling

Structured logs with request correlation IDs. API keys, access tokens, passwords, and secrets are never logged, and full sensitive customer content is avoided unless necessary. Errors surface safe messages; stack traces and internal details are never returned in production responses. Exceptions are never silently swallowed.

## Auditing

Privileged and administrative actions are recorded in an audit log, including platform owner actions, which never bypass auditing.

## Supply chain

Controlled dependency versions, dependency vulnerability scanning, secret scanning, and container scanning where practical.
