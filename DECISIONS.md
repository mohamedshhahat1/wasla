# Architecture Decisions

Records significant architectural decisions only. Trivial implementation details are not recorded here.

## ADR-001 — Multi-Tenancy Strategy

Date:
2026-08-21

Status:
Accepted

Decision:
Use shared PostgreSQL infrastructure with `tenant_id` isolation enforced in the repository and service layers.

Context:
Wasla is a multi-tenant SaaS platform expected to serve many businesses, each owning conversations, contacts, leads, knowledge, agents, usage, and billing data.

Reason:
A shared schema keeps operations, migrations, and connection pooling simple at this stage, while still allowing a move to schema-per-tenant or database-per-tenant for large customers later. Row-level security can be layered on top without changing the data model.

Consequences:
Every tenant-owned table carries `tenant_id` with an index. Every repository query must filter by tenant. Tenant isolation must be covered by explicit tests, because a single missing filter becomes a data-leak bug.

## ADR-002 — Global Users with Tenant Memberships

Date:
2026-08-21

Status:
Accepted

Decision:
A User is a global platform identity. Company access is expressed as `User -> Membership -> Tenant`, with roles scoped to the membership and `UNIQUE(user_id, tenant_id)` enforced. `user.tenant_id` is never used as the authoritative relationship.

Context:
One person may own one company, administer another, and be a member of a third, and must be able to create and switch companies from a single account.

Reason:
Membership-scoped roles are the only model that supports multi-workspace users without duplicate accounts, and it makes the authorization chain explicit: user, membership, tenant, role, resource.

Consequences:
Requests carry an active workspace context. A client-provided tenant identifier is only trusted after membership verification. Invitations, suspension, and removal operate on memberships rather than users.

## ADR-003 — Platform Roles Separated from Tenant Roles

Date:
2026-08-21

Status:
Accepted

Decision:
Maintain two distinct role scopes: platform (`PLATFORM_OWNER`, `PLATFORM_ADMIN`) and tenant (`TENANT_OWNER`, `TENANT_ADMIN`, `MEMBER`), with a dedicated platform administration layer under `app/platform/` and `/api/v1/platform/*`.

Context:
The Wasla SaaS operator needs cross-tenant visibility for support, billing, and analytics, which is a fundamentally different permission domain from a customer company owner.

Reason:
Mixing the two scopes is a common source of privilege-escalation bugs. Separate roles, routers, and services make the boundary auditable.

Consequences:
Platform endpoints never reuse tenant authorization dependencies. Platform actions do not bypass audit logging.

## ADR-004 — Clean Architecture with Service and Repository Layers

Date:
2026-08-21

Status:
Accepted

Decision:
Routes stay thin; business logic lives in services/use cases; database access lives in repositories; external providers sit behind integration clients injected through dependency injection.

Context:
The platform must remain testable without live Meta or OpenAI credentials and must absorb new channels and providers without rewrites.

Reason:
Explicit layering keeps the agent orchestrator testable outside FastAPI and prevents provider details from leaking into business logic.

Consequences:
More files and interfaces than a flat layout, and a standing rule against business logic in route handlers. Abstractions are added when a real seam exists, not speculatively.

## ADR-005 — Async SQLAlchemy 2.0 with Alembic Migrations

Date:
2026-08-21

Status:
Accepted

Decision:
Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 declarative models with `AsyncSession` and manage all schema changes through Alembic migrations.

Context:
The workload is I/O-bound: webhooks, database calls, Redis, Meta and OpenAI HTTP requests.

Reason:
Async sessions match FastAPI's concurrency model, and migration-only schema evolution is mandatory for a production SaaS.

Consequences:
Blocking drivers and libraries must be avoided or run in worker threads. Schema is never mutated outside migrations. CI validates that migrations apply cleanly.

## ADR-006 — Redis for Queues, Cache, and Scheduling

Date:
2026-08-21

Status:
Accepted

Decision:
Use Redis as the queue, cache, rate-limit, and follow-up scheduling backend, with idempotent workers consuming queued jobs.

Context:
WhatsApp webhooks must return immediately while AI, media, ingestion, campaign, and follow-up work happens asynchronously. Meta retries webhook deliveries.

Reason:
Redis is already required for caching and rate limiting, so reusing it avoids introducing a separate broker before the scale justifies it.

Consequences:
Jobs must be idempotent and keyed on WhatsApp event IDs. Durability guarantees are weaker than a dedicated broker, so a migration path to a stronger queue is kept open behind the queue abstraction.

## ADR-007 — OpenAI Responses API Behind an Integration Layer

Date:
2026-08-21

Status:
Accepted

Decision:
Use the current official OpenAI Responses API for agent inference, accessed only through `app/integrations/openai/`, with configurable models per agent. Deprecated OpenAI APIs are not used.

Context:
Agents need tool calling, structured outputs, conversation context, and token accounting, and model choice must be configurable per tenant agent.

Reason:
A single integration boundary keeps SDK details out of services, enables deterministic tests with fakes, and centralises retries, timeouts, and token usage recording.

Consequences:
Services depend on internal request/response types rather than SDK objects. Provider changes are absorbed in one module. API keys are configuration-only and never logged.

## ADR-008 — pgvector for Tenant-Scoped RAG

Date:
2026-08-21

Status:
Accepted

Decision:
Store document chunk embeddings in PostgreSQL using the pgvector extension, with every similarity query filtered by `tenant_id`.

Context:
Each tenant has an isolated knowledge base, and retrieval must never cross tenants.

Reason:
Keeping vectors in the primary database avoids a second datastore, keeps chunks transactionally consistent with their documents, and lets tenant filtering be expressed as an ordinary SQL predicate.

Consequences:
The PostgreSQL image must ship pgvector, enabled via migration. Index strategy and embedding dimensions must be reviewed as volume grows; a dedicated vector database remains an option behind the retrieval service.
